# Hypothesis-Testing
Description: Welcome to the Statistics Coding Practice repository! ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆ Here, you'll find a collection of hands-on coding exercises and projects centered around essential statistical concepts, **hypothesis testing, z-test, t-test, A/B testing** and probability distributions. 

ðŸ“š Key Features ðŸ“š

**Hypothesis Testing:** Dive into the world of hypothesis testing with a series of practical coding challenges. Explore one-sample and two-sample tests, p-values, confidence intervals, z-test t-test and more as you sharpen your ability to draw meaningful conclusions from data.
**Probability Distributions:** Get hands-on experience working with various probability distributions, including the normal, binomial, and Poisson distributions. Code your way through simulations, calculations, and visualizations to gain an intuitive understanding of random processes.
